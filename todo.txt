TODO:
I've only done chrome, since we got barely any firefox or safari requests as it is
How can we test for referer to be different than source?
ConnectionKeepAlive marks everything as positive
Currently reading every X- header as one and the same
Can't figure out how to test modlishka, each IP is different
MITMProxy has two real differences, both in ordering (Sec_Ch_Ua_Headers_Order
    and Pragma_Cache_Control_Order) which I havent figured out yet

Evilginx : 142.93.155.177
Traefik : 159.223.56.15
MITMProxy : 147.182.196.179
Squid : 178.128.225.42
HAProxy : 170.64.227.20
Modlishka : ?

Precision is how many of the predicted positives are actually correct
Recall is how many positives were marked out of the total number of positives (TP/TotalPositive). A value close to 1 is 100%
F1 Score provides a balance of both precision and recall
